    "# Audiovisual Speech Reconition\n",
    "In this lab you will develop a bi-modal speech recognizer that makes use of both audio and visual features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "The data that you will use corresponds to 10 utterances of the digit \"2\" and 10 utterances of the digit \"5\". \n",
    "The feature extraction has already been done.\n",
    "These features can be found in the data/ folder. \n",
    "It contains both speech features and visual lip tracking features for all utterances. \n",
    "You can read data/README.md for more details about the content of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hidden Markov Model\n",
    "The method that you will use to develop your bi-modal speech recognizer is the Hidden Markov Model(HMM):\n",
    "\n",
    "> The HMM is based on augmenting the Markov chain. A Markov chain is a model that  tells  us  something  about  the  probabilities  of  sequences  of  random  variables,states, each of which can take on values from some set. These sets can be words, or tags, or symbols representing anything, like the weather.  A Markov chain makes a very strong assumption that if we want to predict the future in the sequence, all that matters is the current state. The states before the current state have no impact on the future except via the current state. It’s as if to predict tomorrow’s weather you could examine today’s weather but you weren’t allowed to look at yesterday’s weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A Markov chain is useful when we need to compute a probability for a sequence of observable events. In many cases, however, the events we are interested in are hidden: we don’t observe them directly. For example we don’t normally observe hidden part-of-speech tags in a text. Rather, we see words, and must infer the tags from the word sequence. We call the tags hidden because they are not observed. A hidden Markov model(HMM) allows us to talk about both observed events (like words that we see in the input) and hidden events (like part-of-speech tags) that we think of as causal factors in our probabilistic model.\n",
    "\n",
    "> An HMM is specified by the following components:\n",
    "* $Q=q_1q_2...q_N$ a set of $N$ states\n",
    "* $A=A_{11}...a_{ij}...a_{NN}$ a **transition probability matrix** $A$, each $a_{ij}$ representing the probability of moving from state $i$ to state $j$, s.t. $\\sum^N_{j=1}a_{ij}=1$  $\\forall i$\n",
    "* $O=o_1o_2...o_T$ a sequence of $T$ **observations**, each one drawn from a vocabulary $V=v_1,v_2,...,v_V$\n",
    "* $B=b_i(o_t)$ a sequence of **observation likelihoods**, also called **emission probabilities**, each expressing the probability of an obervation $o_t$ being generated from state $i$\n",
    "* $\\pi=\\pi_1,\\pi_2,...,\\pi_N$ an **initial probability distribution** over states. $\\pi_i$ being the probability that the Markov chain will start in state $i$. Some states $j$ may have $\\pi_j=0$, meaning that they cannot be initial states. Also, $\\sum^n_{i=1}pi_i=1$\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab focuses on two of the fundamental HMM problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  Learning: Given an observation sequence $O$ and the set of states in the HMM, learn the HMM parameters A and B. \n",
    "*  Likelihood: Given a HMM $\\lambda = (A,B)$ and on observation sequence $O$, determine the likelihood $P(O|\\lambda)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are provided with code that implements the EM algorithm and the Forward-Backward algorithm which solve these problems.\n",
    "The code is only partially complete however. It is up to you to fill in the gaps.\n"

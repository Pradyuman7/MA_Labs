# How to work with a python notebook
A python notebook is an environment where you can execute python code, have rich text and display images.

It works with cells in which you can enter code or text. 
You can select a code cell and click the run button to run the code. 
When you execute a code cell with output, it will be displayed in an output cell below it.

Functions and variables are shared in the same notebook.
If you make a change to a function, make sure to run the code where you define it again.
If you restart the kernel, all functions and variables are lost and have to be run again as well.

Make sure that your changes are saved (File -> Save and Checkpoint) before you close the notebook.
